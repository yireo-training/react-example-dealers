# Example Dealers - React component
Example React component for connecting to a Magento 2 GraphQL endpoint `dealers`.

## Usage
Copy this component to the source of your React app. Make sure Apollo Client is initialized somewhere in
the tree, so that `useQuery` can be used.

## Requirements
- React with Apollo client (including hooks)
- Magento 2.3 GraphQL API with [Example Dealers](https://github.com/yireo-training/magento2-example-dealers)

## Todo
- Add a `package.json` and this to NPMJS.org so it can be installed via `yarn add @yireo-training/react-example-dealers`
